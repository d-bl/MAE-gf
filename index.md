## Introduction
On this website you find pages with additional patterns for use in Groundforge, a webapplication made by [Jo Pol][gf-jo]. Given are the parameter-section and, in most cases, stitches, although not always traditional.

## How to use these pages
All examples are links to the Groundforge main page. Just follow the link. Please feel free to play with the stitches. E.g. try what happens if you change the default <span class="stch">ctc</span> of the spiders or fish in <span class="stch">ct</span>.     

Some examples lead to the Groundforge page with Droste-effect. After clicking <span class="elem">SHOW</span>, click <span class="elem">SHOW</span> in the <span class="elem">LEVEL 2</span> section of the form.

The examples use pair-diagrams in the styled version (_matrix-scheme_) that Groundforge understands.
Most of the patterns also have a scheme in the TesseLace index. Some, as the spiders and the larger fishes, don't.

## Contact
You will find our email-adres on the [_About us_][aboutus] page.

## Disclaimer
All links worked when created. Due to work on the Groundforge coding, there may be hiccups. 

English is not my native language, so please forgive me any mistakes.
