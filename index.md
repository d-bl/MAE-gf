## Introduction
On this website you find pages with additional patterns for use in Groundforge, a webapplication made by [Jo Pol][gf-jo]. Given are the parameter-section and, in most cases, stitches, although not always traditional.

## How to use these pages
All examples are links to the Groundforge main page. Follow the link and click <span class="elem">SHOW</span> in the <span class="elem">PAIR/THREAD DIAGRAM</span> section. Please feel free to play with the stitches. E.g. try what happens if you change the default <span class="stch">ctc</span> of the spiders or fish in <span class="stch">ct</span>.     
Some examples use <span class="elem">LEVEL 2</span>. After clicking <span class="elem">SHOW</span>, click <span class="elem">SHOW</span> in the <span class="elem">LEVEL 2</span> section of the form.
Some examples are links to the Groundforge "tiles" page. Follow the link. In time, alle examples will lead to these page.

The examples use pair-diagrams in the styled version (_matrix-scheme_) that Groundforge understands. If you wish to see this scheme, click <span class="elem">DIAGRAM</span>.
Most of the patterns also have a scheme in the TesseLace index. Some, as the spiders and the larger fishes, don't.

## Contact
You will find our email-adres on the [_About us_][aboutus] page.

## Disclaimer
All links worked when created. Due to work on the Groundforge coding, there may be hiccups. 

English is not my native language, so please forgive me any mistakes.
