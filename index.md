## Introduction
On this website you will find pages with additional patterns for use in Groundforge, a web application made by [Jo Pol][gf-jo]. Given are the parameter-section and stitches, although not always traditional.    

## How to use these pages
All examples are links to the Groundforge main page. Just follow the link. If a picture has a light-blue coloured border, click on the picture. Please feel free to play with the stitches. E.g. try what happens if you change the default <span class="stch">ctc</span> of the spiders or fish in <span class="stch">ct</span>.     

The examples use pair-diagrams in the styled version (_matrix-scheme_) that Groundforge understands.
Most of the patterns also have a scheme in the TesseLace index. Some, as the spiders and the larger fishes, don't.

## Contact
You will find our email-adress on the [_About us_][aboutus] page.

## Disclaimer
All links worked when created. Due to work on the Groundforge coding, there may be hiccups. 

English is not my native language, so please forgive me any mistakes.
