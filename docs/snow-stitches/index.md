Introduction
------------

We have a [tutorial] that explains how to choose stitches in GroundForge.
However, these experiments require some preparation: capture the pair diagram.

The tutorial uses a versatile Binche pattern as an example.
This happens to be a 6-pair snowflake alias spider embedded in a Paris ground.
On this page we explore more fun with snowflakes.

[tutorial]: /GroundForge-help/Binche

### Capture pair diagrams

![](connect-dots.svg?align=right)

Before we can play with stitches, we need to capture the pair diagram.
Most captures start with a distorted pair diagram. Each stitch should match a dot on a square grid.
Variations or combinations require new distorted captures. 

### Alternative

Based on experiments on this page, a new versatile [snow mixer](/GroundForge/mix4snow) has been developed. 
This mixer displays inline diagrams to avoid switching between pages for each attempt.
[Its tutorial](/GroundForge-help/snow-mix) explains recipes that also work in form fields on this page.  

6 pairs with all pairs entering before leaving
----------------------------------------------

Unlike the snow mixer mentioned above, the form below is limited to a single snowflake but in two arrangements. 
More importantly it supports odd numbers of stitches in a recipe and a theoretically unlimited number.
The form jumps to the _pair diagrams from thread diagrams_ page where you can choose your stitches in the second step.

![](3-pair-plaits.png?align=right)

**Do nothing** for the footside means: the pairs turn as a rainbow around the pin, without twists. 
The _just twist_ option is under construction, a proper footside interferes with the adjacent snowflake.

**Variants:** 
The form jumps straight to the _pair diagrams from thread diagrams_ page were you can generate the final diagrams.
When following the link _Back to the initial pair diagram_ and subsequently _pattern definition_, 
you will see diagrams as on the right:
Short plaits of three threads for each snowflake. 
Depending on your choice, these plaits are arranged in a diamond mesh or a square mesh.
The length of the plaits are determined by the number of blobs.
With a square mesh you will have two pairs going horizontally back and forth through the snowflakes
The pattern definitions shows that both variants have the same footsides. 
The footsides have additional columns with snowflakes, these interfere with the footsides.
Note that the square variant flips the snowflakes on the returning rows.

**Steps:** The form jumps immediately to the _pair diagrams from thread diagrams_ page to generate diagrams as shown below at the first step. 
Well, we cheated a little: some twists are added manually for the legs to make the snowflake stand out more clearly.
If you want parallel legs: donÂ´t add the twists. If your want crossed legs: add the twists. 
The number of twists is not relevant for the next step.

At the second step on the page _pair from threads_ you can finally choose your stitches.
When you opted for the square mesh, you have to apply stitches to two snowflakes.

![](last-step.png)

![](combined-twist.png?align=right)

The twists of the first step thread diagram shown on the right are combined into stitch b133 above.
These twists are the trailing twist in the last blob and the leading twist of the first blob.
The combining is counteracted with a ctct(pin)tctc. Pins usually get misplaced, so we leave them out.
This counteraction also defines the number of twists in the left footside for the _just twist_ option of variant _a_.

Hover with your mouse over stitches. Highlights can show you all parts of a stitch.
Note that each thread diagram adds a digit to stitch id in the tooltips:
B13 in the step one pair diagram becomes b130,b131,... in the step one thread diagram.
We see b133 reappearing in the step two pair diagram resulting in b1330,b1331,... in the step two thread diagram.

Both can help to fix mistakes as the leg inside the spider in this example.
Click wands to generate or refresh diagrams. 
Refresh a thread diagram after refreshing the pair diagram.
Please don't rely on twist marks in the pair diagrams, they are buggy in this style of pair diagrams.

### Other patterns than supplied by the form

![](fish-base-for-star.png?align=right)

When we focus on recipes with four blobs, the plaits are reduced to two triangles with a shared side.
The image on the right shows variations of these figures. These figures occur in many patterns.
Wherever we discover these figures, we can use three pair joins in these patterns,
or snowflakes when using the thread diagram as pair diagram. Just some examples:

[![](tl-502.png)](/GroundForge/stitches.html?tile=5-L-K-E-,-L-L-O-O,K-H-5-L-,-5-K-E-E&patchHeight=12&patchWidth=24&shiftColsSW=-4&shiftRowsSW=4&shiftColsSE=4&shiftRowsSE=4) &nbsp;

### In a Paris ground (under construction)

![](snow-in-paris.png?align=right)

The [tutorial] for choosing stitches captured the pair diagram directly.
When using the thread diagram of this [pattern](/GroundForge/stitches.html?patchWidth=19&patchHeight=16&tile=-5-,6-5,-5-,5-5,-58,5-4&shiftColsSW=0&shiftRowsSW=6&shiftColsSE=3&shiftRowsSE=3&b1=ct&c2=ct&a2=cllcr&b3=cl&c4=ctc&a4=ct&c5=-&b5=crrcl&c6=ctc&a6=cr&droste2=ctc,c20=c21=b30=b31=c22=a60=a61=a42=b11=ctct,b53=b10=b12=rctct,a23=a40=a41=lctct)
we also get snowflakes in a Paris ground. 
You only need the first step of the _pair diagrams from thread diagrams_ page.
Definition for the ring pair at the first _pair diagrams from thread diagrams_ step:

    ctc
    c20=c21=b30=b31=c22=a60=a61=a42=b11=ctct
    b53=b10=b12=rctct
    a23=a40=a41=lctct

The screenshot dropped the stitch marked with a grey `+`,
for more variations you can restore the stitch with the button `assign to ignored`.
The highlighted stitches in the thread diagram represent the blobs.
The configuration of blobs is not as versatile as for the form above.

6 pairs, on both sides a pair leaves before the last enters (under construction)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We explore two snowflakes to demonstrate the two templates. The dashed lines indicate bouncing pairs:
these pairs leave the snowflake before last pair enters. 
It might be a bit confusing, but the snowflake is still a 6-pair snowflake.
In reality the pairs might not return but play another role in the rest of the lace while another pair "returns".

![](4-3254-2.svg) <!-- TODO content beyond the visible area is more related to the counting-snow page -->

In the first example above (lct-tcr), each bouncing pair section (the dashed lines) interacts with just one other bouncing pair section.
In the second example we see more interactions between the bouncing pairs.
The first example requires two stitches to define a thread diagram to be used as pair diagram, the second one requires three stitches.

The following form generates the diagrams shown below the form.
Note the subtle difference for the open and closed connection in diagram variations for the three-stitch example.
Follow the link to "_thread diagram as pair diagram_" to select your stitches for the snowflake.

The number of legs is deceptive, caused by the bouncing pairs. 
We can get more realistic lengths for the legs at the next step.
The screenshot on the right shows manually added red pins to indicate the actual legs.
