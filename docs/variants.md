## Introduction
On this page we show how variants can be made on several grounds.

## Rose ground    
### Changing corners
![corners][p-corners]
An easy way to make a variant on a Rose ground, is by changing the corner stitches, indicated in blue in the picture on the right. See the following examples of the same rose ground. Of course, there are more possibilities, e.g. <span class="stch">lctcr</span> and <span class="stch">rctcl</span>. The first two examples, without a cross at the corners, are a diamond net ground.

[![tctct][p-ttt]][0502-D]
[![ctctctc][p-cccc]][0502-KF]
[![tctctct][p-tttt]][0502-NF]

### Changing sides
Other variations can be made by "doing nothing" on the sides, indicated in green in the picture on the right. If both pins on top and bottom (red in picture) are replaced with only one pin in the middle, we'll get a Paris ground. See [stretched Paris ground](#stretched-paris-ground). Some of these variants can also be made as diagonal nets.

## Bias ground
![p-note-1]
Traditionally, a bias ground is made as follows: make two stitches diagonally, make a stitch in the middle with these two, make two diagonal, stitch in the middle, etc. Usually, the same stitch is applied for this connecting stitch in the middle. See the green dots on the picture to the right.          

![p-note-2]
We can make many variants, by applying two or more different stitches for the middle stitch, see the dots in the picture.

![p-note-3]
More variants can be made by making connections at the corners, like the rose-ground.    
The colors in the picture have no meaning.

## Little snowflake, crossed in corner
### Changing corners
![p-snowcorner]
The same way as with the roseground, variants can be made by changing the corners, indicated with blue dots in the picture on the right.
