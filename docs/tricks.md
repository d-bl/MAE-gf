## Ground names

Unfortunately, grounds do not have one unique name. Not even in one language. Also, the same name is used for different grounds. To make naming even more difficult, Groundforge does not make a difference in Torchon or Flemish grounds.    

![rose v.s. slavic][p-rs-sl]
Example: The picture shows the working-scheme's of one unit of <i>Slavic rose ground</i> and one unit of <i>Fond au cinq trous</i>. Groundforge gives the same [result][t-rs-sl].
<p style="clear: both"></p>

![snow v.s. spider][p-sn-sp]
We have learned, that the figure on the left is called a [_little snowflake_][t-snowflake] and the figure on the right a [_spider_][t-spider]. Groundforge does not make this difference. It only depends on the stitch in the centre: <span class="stch">ctcctc</span> for the spider or <span class="stch">ctc</span> for the snowflake.

## Color code

![colours][p-colors]
Colors used in the examples on these pages:

* Cross only. In working scheme's coloured in <span class="b-grey">grey</span>.
* Half stitch = (twist if not already done), cross, twist. Coloured <span class="b-gree">green</span>.
* Cloth stitch = cross, twist, cross. Coloured <span class="b-purp">purple</span>.
* Whole stitch = (twist if not already done), cross, twist, cross, twist. Coloured <span class="b-red">red</span>.
* Plaits = (twist,) cross, twist, cross, twist, cross (, twist), .... . Coloured <span class="b-blue">blue</span>.      
* All other stitches in <span class="b-blck">black</span>.
<p style="clear: both"></p>

## Stitches used

Sometimes, onorthodox stitches are used, like <span class="stch">cross only</span> or <span class="stch">crcllcrc</span>, as in the [_Sunny Stitch_](roses#sunny-stitch).    
We have tried <span class="stch">ctctclllllctctc</span> as a substitute for picots. Groundforge needs some time to generate this, and the result is not as expected.       

The specified twists in some stitch definitions may not be according to the expected working order. Example : <span class="stch">B1 = ctc, A2 = rrct, C2 = llct</span> instead of <span class="stch">B1 = ctctt, A2 = ct, C2 = ct</span>. The result is the same.
