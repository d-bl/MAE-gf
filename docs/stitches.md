## Introduction

A bobbin lace stitch is defined as something that happens when four bobbins meet on a pillow. On this page, we present an incomplete list of stitches to choose from. There are more than a 1000 possibilities.     
On page [_couting and listing stitches_][page-counting], we will show a logical ordering of the stitches and the way we counted them.     

[page-counting]: ../docs/counting

## Pins

In the following paragraph, the stitches are shown without telling where to place a pin.    

## Stitches

Each stitch has links to a page with thread diagrams generated by Groundforge. Please allow the page to build up.        
The samples and photo's are made by S. Babbs. Clicking on the photo shows a larger image.
