## Introduction

A bobbin lace stitch is defined as something that happens when four bobbins meet on a pillow. On this page, we present an incomplete list of stitches to choose from. There are more than a 1000 possibilities.     
On page [_couting and listing stitches_][page-counting], we will show a logical ordering of the stitches and the way we counted them.

## Stitches

Each stitch has links to GroundForge. The first link is a diagonal net, the second one a horizontal net. If the stitch is "a-symmetrical", the 'horizontal' link shows the stitch applied from left to right, and the mirrored stitch from right to left. The 'horizontal reversed' link shows the mirrored stitch from left to right and the named stitch right to left.  
Clicking on the photo shows a larger image.
