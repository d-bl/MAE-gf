### Introduction
<img alt="pg unit" align="right" src="https://maetempels.github.io/MAE-gf/images_wt/gf-pg-unit.png">

In this article we show several placings of one unit of the _Pagoda_ or _Triangular_ ground. One unit is shown in 
the picture on the right.          
Please note that some of the examples are mirrored.         

### Traditional pagoda's

  caption="Please note: traditionally the pagoda-ground uses a weaver which returns round the pin with two twists at the pointy bit. The example looked better not turning."

### Pagoda in a square
The units can be placed all facing in the same direction, or alternating.

### Building Pagoda's
Bigger pagoda's can be build much in the same way as building bigger [_fish_][fish-page].            
The coloured dots indicate what goes where when translating the working scheme into a matrix. The black lines indicate one unit, the grey lines show where the other units connect.

  content="The unit on the left looks more like the working-scheme. It works nice as a building block for the traditional pagoda, however, the matrix-scheme's for the other pagoda examples are harder to achieve."
