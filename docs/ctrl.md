## Introduction

A bobbin lace stitch is defined as something that happens when four bobbins meet on a pillow. On this page, we present an incomplete list of stitches to choose from. There are more than a 1000 possibilities.     
On a future "counting stiches"-page, we will show a logical ordering of the stitches and the way we counted them.
