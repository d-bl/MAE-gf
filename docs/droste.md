## Introduction
Some grounds could not be made in GroundForge, only as "Droste-effect". To make it easier to play with, this page consists of several forms to make playing easier. See page [_Droste-effect_][pg-droste] on the Groundforge help-pages for more information.

## Wobble

![](../images/wobble2.png)

This ground was invented by J. Pol. 
The name was inspired by the pricking on the left.
This pricking is based on the generated thread diagram.
On the right a distorted version that matches a Torchon grid. 
The units of the rose-ground are placed in different directions.
These units can be replaced with units of a bias ground.

The left pricking is generated with one of the 
"ground from template" [tools](https://d-bl.github.io/inkscape-bobbinlace/Ground-from-Template)
and a plain text file with the content shown below.
The image above can be worked top down. A generated pattern should be worked left-to-right.
Likewise when generated as a circle, it should be worked inside out, not along the perimeter.

```

After completing the stitches in the form below,
press <span class="elem">go</span> for the desired type of units.
and then the ![](../images/wand.png) in the advanced section.

(This needs some more text, and a picture that shows what goes where.)
