## Introduction
Some grounds could not be made in GroundForge, only as "Droste-effect". To make it easier to play with, this page consists of several forms to make playing easier. See page [_Droste-effect_][pg-droste] on the Groundforge help-pages for more information.

## Wobble

This family of grounds was discovered by J. Pol. 
The name was inspired by the left pricking.

### Pricking
<img src="../images/wobble.png" style="float: right; margin-left:1em"/>

![](../images/wobble2.png)

The left pricking is generated with one of the "ground from template" 
[tools](https://d-bl.github.io/inkscape-bobbinlace/Ground-from-Template)
and a plain text file (<a href="../data/wobble.txt" download>download</a>).

On the right a distorted version that matches a Torchon grid. 
The units of the rose-ground are placed in different directions, indicated with blue arrows.
These units can be replaced with units of a bias ground.
The green numbers and arrows indicate the working order inherited frm the first pair diagram.

### Generate diagrams (color coded and threads)

After completing the stitches in the form below,
press <span class="elem">go</span> for the desired type of units.
In the page that will appear next, click the ![](../images/wand.png)
in the advanced section for the thread diagram.

## Zeccatello
The Whiting sampler has a "Fancy Zeccatello" ground:
[F12](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge/tiles?whiting=F12_P190&patchWidth=16&patchHeight=16&f1=ctc&d1=tctct&b1=ctc&g2=ctctctc&e2=tctct&c2=tctct&a2=ctctctc&f3=ctc&d3=tctct&b3=ctc&g4=ctcrrctc&f4=ctc&e4=ctcllctc&c4=ctcrrctc&b4=ctc&a4=ctcllctc&tile=-4-5-7--,b-5-5-c-,-5-5-5--,a15-58d-&footsideStitch=ctctt&tileStitch=ctc&headsideStitch=ctctt&shiftColsSW=-4&shiftRowsSW=4&shiftColsSE=4&shiftRowsSE=4).
M. Tempels discovered it can also be made as a level 2 
[ground](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge/tiles?patchWidth=12&patchHeight=16&c1=clcrct&a1=crclct&d2=ctct&droste2=ctct,c11=a13=ctcllctc,a11=c13=ctcrrctc,d25=c10=c12=c14=ctc,d24=a10=a12=a14,a16=c15=ctctctc&tile=B-C-,---5&footsideStitch=ctctt&tileStitch=ctc&headsideStitch=ctctt&shiftColsSW=-2&shiftRowsSW=2&shiftColsSE=2&shiftRowsSE=2), 
starting with the Paris ground.
