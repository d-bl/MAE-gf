## Introduction
Some grounds could not be made in GroundForge, only as "Droste-effect". To make it easier to play with, this page consists of several forms to make playing easier. See page [_Droste-effect_][pg-droste] on the Groundforge help-pages for more information.

## Wobble

This family of grounds was discovered by J. Pol. 
The name was inspired by the left pricking.

### Pricking

![](../images/wobble2.png)

The left pricking is generated with one of the "ground from template" 
[tools](https://d-bl.github.io/inkscape-bobbinlace/Ground-from-Template)
and a plain text file (<a href="../data/wobble.txt" download>download</a>).

On the right a distorted version that matches a Torchon grid. 
The units of the rose-ground are placed in different directions.
These units can be replaced with units of a bias ground.
The green line indicates the working order inherited frm the first pair diagram.

### Generate diagrams (color coded and threads)

After completing the stitches in the form below,
press <span class="elem">go</span> for the desired type of units.
In the page that will appear next, click the ![](../images/wand.png)
in the advanced section for the thread diagram.

## Zeccantello
The Whiting-index shows several "Zeccantello" grounds. We found, that these can be made as a level 2 ground, starting with the Paris ground. _under construction_
