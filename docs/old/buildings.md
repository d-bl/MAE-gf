## Fish building.
The general fish scheme looks like the schemes in the picture. Of course, other scheme's are possible. Please note that an even or odd number of "waves" dictate if a <span class="elem">brick-matrix</span> is possible.

Building bigger fish is illustrated in the following picture. Please note the change of direction of the weavers.

## Lotus building
The general Lotus scheme looks like the scheme in the picture. Of course, other scheme's are possible.      
Building bigger lotus is similair to the building of bigger fish.

## Building Spiders
Adding legs to a spider is the equivalent of adding a ring to it. So, after discovering the matrix for a 4x3 legged spider, a 4x4 or bigger spider is easy.            
For the complete scheme's we chose to connect the spiders diagonaly. Of course, connecting with a horizontal line will also work. For the spiders in a square, the connection between spider and square has to be horizontal.   

Torchon spiders looks like this:

Spiders with an eye look like this:

## Building Pagoda's
Bigger pagoda's can be build much in the same way as building bigger fish.            
The coloured dots indicate what goes where when translating the working scheme into a matrix. The black lines indicate one unit, the grey lines show where the other units connect.

![alternative unit][pic-uni2]
The unit on the left looks more like the working-scheme. It works nice as a building block for the traditional pagoda, however, the matrix-scheme's for the other pagoda examples are harder to achieve.
